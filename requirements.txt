google-genai==1.7.0
streamlit
google-generativeai # For Gemini API interaction (covers genai and generativeai.types)
selenium          # For browser automation (web scraping)
beautifulsoup4    # For parsing HTML
lxml              # Efficient HTML parser used with BeautifulSoup in the script
faiss-cpu         # For the vector similarity search cache (CPU version is generally easier)
numpy             # Required by FAISS and for embedding arrays
python-dotenv     # For loading .env files locally (as discussed in the README)

# Note:
# - webdriver-manager was in your list but isn't used in the original script's setup
#   (which relies on manual ChromeDriver placement or PATH). You could adapt the script
#   to use webdriver-manager if you prefer automated driver handling.
# - sentence-transformers and scikit-learn were in your list but are not used by
#   this script, which uses Google's embedding model directly.
